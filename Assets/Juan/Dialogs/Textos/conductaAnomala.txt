End whatever is killing me right now if you value your life. I won't say it again, I'm not playing games.

What if, at the end of the day, we are just like sunflowers clinging to life like they cling to the sun?

What am I doing here? Five minutes ago I was in my bed, and suddenly I just appeared here with you.
